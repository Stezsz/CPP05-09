# ⚙️ C++ Modules – 42 School Projects (CPP05–CPP09)

These modules continue the C++ series from 42 School, focusing on mastering Object-Oriented Programming, exception handling, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL).  
Each module builds on the previous ones, moving towards modern and production-level C++ programming.

## CPP05 – Exceptions and Bureaucracy

**Main Topics:**
- Exception handling (`try`, `catch`, `throw`)
- Nested and abstract classes
- Static members and constants
- Class relationships and dependencies

**Goals:**
- Handle runtime errors safely and clearly  
- Build classes that respect exception safety  
- Deepen understanding of inheritance in practical systems  

> ✅ **Final Grade: pending/100**

## CPP06 – Type Casting and Serialization

**Main Topics:**
- `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`
- RTTI (`typeid`)
- Data serialization and reinterpretation
- Type safety and conversion hierarchy

**Goals:**
- Master the C++ casting system  
- Apply safe type conversions  
- Understand data-level manipulation and reinterpretation  

> ✅ **Final Grade: pending/100**

## CPP07 – Templates and Generic Programming

**Main Topics:**
- Function templates  
- Class templates  
- Template specialization  
- Compilation and instantiation mechanisms  

**Goals:**
- Write reusable, generic, and type-safe code  
- Learn how templates are expanded and compiled  
- Use specialization for optimized behaviors  

> ✅ **Final Grade: pending/100**

## CPP08 – STL and Containers

**Main Topics:**
- STL containers (`vector`, `list`, `map`, etc.)  
- Iterators and algorithms (`find`, `sort`, `for_each`, etc.)  
- Custom iterators and generic algorithms  
- Modern C++ container manipulation  

**Goals:**
- Utilize STL containers efficiently  
- Master iterator patterns and algorithm usage  
- Develop custom containers and tools  

> ✅ **Final Grade: pending/100**

## CPP09 – Advanced STL and Parsing

**Main Topics:**
- Parsing and input processing  
- Performance optimization using STL algorithms  
- Custom data structures  
- Problem-solving using modern C++  

**Goals:**
- Build efficient parsing systems  
- Write performant and maintainable C++ code  
- Demonstrate full mastery of STL and algorithmic design
